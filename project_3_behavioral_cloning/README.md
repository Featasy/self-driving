# Behavioral Cloning
This repository aim at well controlling simulator-car. I use Nvdia's end-to-end model which gets perfect performance as this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-96BEoXJMs0&t=27s) demonstrates. After 30-minutes around training, I get seems well performace, the next phase I will deploy this model in real toy-car :D<br/>
